# Lagrange-Interpolation
Solve function by using Lagrange Interpolation method by constructing a polynomial which goes through any desired set of points.

The Lagrange interpolation method is a polynomial interpolation technique used to approximate a function's values between given data points. It constructs a polynomial by taking a weighted sum of basis polynomials, each associated with a data point, which passes through those points and can be used to estimate the function's value at a desired point within the range of the given data.

1) Input the number of points
2) Input the number of interpolation points
3) Input data point/s for  x and y

Result will display the approximate value of the function.
